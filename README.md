# Hello Website (blank)

This is a basic static HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ðŸª„ immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

## What's in this project?

* *`README.md`*: That's this file, that will guide you through this workshop and beyond.

* *`index.html`*: This is the default home page for your website

* *`style.css`*: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

* *`script.js`*: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
* `portfolio-example`: This folder contains a working, responsive website that you can reverse engineer to your *hearts content*.
